        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my website! I'm Charles, a Computer Engineering and Computer Science major at Northeastern University passionate about hardware and embedded systems.<br> I am broadly interested in ECE topics like computer hardware, biomedical devices, and other technology that blends electronics with real-world applications.<br>I enjoy working with oscilloscopes/signal generators/DMMs, circuit design, microcontrollers, and digital logic, always looking to deepen my understanding of how<br>hardware systems are built and optimized. Outside of engineering, I like collecting coins and banknotes because <br>they constitute the intersection of history and the world around us.</p>

        <h3>Human ECG Signal Processing</h3>
        <p>
            This project was part of my Circuits and Signals course, where my lab partner and I explored how electrical signals from the human heart
            (Electrocardiogram or ECG) can be captured and analyzed. Using oscilloscopes, function generators, LTSpice, and MATLAB, we examined ECG 
            signals to understand their frequency components, waveform characteristics, and filtering techniques.
        </p>

        <h4>Takeaways:</h4>
        <ul class="takeaways">
            <li>Worked closely with my lab partner to design, test, and troubleshoot an ECG amplifier circuit for processing heart rate signals.</li>
            <li>Improved proficiency with the oscilloscope, function generator, and digital multimeter (DMM) to measure, visualize, and analyze signals effectively.</li>
            <li>Utilized MATLAB programming for signal analysis, including filtering and Fourier transforms.</li>
            <li>Implemented filtering techniques to reduce noise and enhance signal clarity.</li>
            <li>Gained hands-on experience with signal acquisition and processing tools used in biomedical applications.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Teamwork and hands-on practice were key to mastering signal analysis techniques and refining my ability to work with lab instrumentation in real-world scenarios.</em></p>
